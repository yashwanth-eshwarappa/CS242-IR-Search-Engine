Learn More Getting into Your Major For All Majors In general, each major has prerequisite (major prep) coursework that you must take before transferring in order to get into your major. Take the recommended lower-division/general education/breadth classes for your major. Some programs recommend the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC), which is a series of courses that California Community College students can complete to satisfy first- and second-year general education requirements before transferring. Some programs want you to focus on prerequisites instead of IGETC. Use ASSIST.org to see what your major program recommends or contact a UCR admissions counselor for help. View the Assist Brochure for more information. Each major has a minimum GPA requirement. Some majors require a GPA higher than that required for basic admission. Programs are selective. Strive to surpass your program’s minimum GPA. Remember: All transferable coursework will be taken into account. Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering Requirements Breadth Requirements You are strongly encouraged to focus on preparatory course work (mathematics, science and technical work) for your desired major rather than on IGETC completion. However, the Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering (BCOE) does accept completion of IGETC as satisfying the majority of breadth requirements. Additional breadth coursework may be required after enrollment at BCOE. Prerequisites Strong technical preparation is essential for success in the admissions process and, subsequently, in all coursework at BCOE. If you intend to transfer to an engineering major, you are expected to complete the equivalent of UCR coursework required in the first two years of the programs and apply for transfer starting your junior year. Use ASSIST.org to see the prerequisites you must take for your intended major (and to make sure your classes will transfer). Minimum GPA Strive to surpass the 2.8 minimum GPA. Learn more about transferring to BCOE. College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences Requirements Breadth Requirements Complete IGETC or the UCR breadth pattern for the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (CHASS). Prerequisites Use ASSIST.org to see the prerequisites you must take for your intended major (and to make sure your classes will transfer). Minimum GPA Strive to surpass the 2.4 minimum GPA and the 2.7 minimum GPA for neuroscience and psychology. Learn more about transferring to CHASS. College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences Requirements Breadth Requirements You are strongly encouraged to focus on preparatory coursework (mathematics, science and technical work) for your desired major rather than on IGETC completion. Prerequisites Use ASSIST.org to see the prerequisites you must take for your intended major (and to make sure your classes will transfer). Minimum GPA Strive to surpass the 2.7 minimum GPA. Learn more about being a CNAS student. School of Business Requirements Breadth Requirements IGETC or the UCR breadth pattern for the School of Business is highly recommended. Prerequisites Complete community college courses equivalent to seven lower division UCR business major requirements as listed on ASSIST.org Minimum GPA Attain a minimum GPA of 2.7 in all UC-transferable coursework and a minimum 2.5 GPA in the seven lower division major prerequisites. These GPAs are a baseline for consideration and are not a guarantee of admission. Learn more about being a School of Business student.

If you have additional questions, please contact us tour@ucr.edu. General Questions Do I need a parking permit? Yes, permits are always required when parking in any UCR lot. The good news is that parking is complimentary if you reserve your tour/visit ahead of time, available in Lot 1. Please check in at the Lot 1 kiosk to pick up your pass. However, if for any reason you need to purchase a parking permit , an all-day pass ranges from $9–13 and paid parking is available in Lots 6 and 24. Tip: We recommend entering UCR Lot 1 in Google Maps when driving to campus. Where should I stay? There are many hotels near campus . Some hotels offer a discounted UCR rate if you request it. UCR is not affiliated or responsible for any third-party accommodations you arrange with the hotels listed. Does UCR have an overnight stay program? No, not at this time. What should I wear? Wear comfortable walking shoes. Dress for weather and temperature variations. Pants and closed-toe shoes are required for BCOE lab tours. What is the best day to visit? With a beautiful campus like ours, any day is the best day! If you want the full campus experience, plan your visit for when classes are in session. But if you're looking for less hustle and bustle, plan it for the off season (midterms/finals and summer quarter). Does UCR have an open house? Yes. Highlander Day happens every year in the spring, typically on a weekend in April. At Highlander Day, you’ll chat with faculty, hang out with current students, learn about our many academic programs and take a student-led campus tour. View current events at UCR . When are you open? The Campus Tours Office is open Monday through Friday, 9 a.m.–4 p.m., excluding all national holidays. We are also open on select Saturdays during special events (Discover Day, Highlander Day, etc.). Are there restaurants or places to eat on campus? Yes, campus dining options include the HUB Food Court (featuring Chronic Tacos, Hibachi-San, MOD Pizza, and Panda Express), The Habit, and Subway. If you need a coffee fix, stop by Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (HUB), Ivan's (Hinderaker Hall), Bytes (Winston Chung Hall), Emerbee's (between MRB and MSE), or Starbucks (Market at Glen Mor). UCR also has campus food trucks, Scotty's convenience stores, residential dining, and the signature Barn dining and entertainment venue (reopening in early 2020). Visit dining.ucr.edu to explore all campus dining options. Reserving Your Tour Are reservations required for tours? Yes. You must make a reservation in advance. This allows our staff to properly prepare for your tour. After making your reservation, you’ll receive a confirmation email with details about your visit. During spring and fall quarters, space is limited – we suggest reserving early. When are tours offered? Group tours for High School and Community College groups will be offered at a very limited capacity for the remainder of the 2022 academic school year. How do I change or cancel my tour? You can cancel and schedule a new tour online using the link in your confirmation email. DO NOT schedule another tour until you cancel your first tour. Doing so creates a duplicate tour reservation. Thank you for letting us know. Canceling your tour allows us to open up space for other visitors. I can’t make any of the tour times. How can I see the campus? You can always take a virtual tour or if you want to see the campus in-person, you can print out one of our self-guided tour maps and explore UCR on your own. Are tours cancelled if it rains? No. Tours happen rain or shine! Please prepare for the weather accordingly. Do you offer tours in any language other than English? We sometimes have staff Campus Tour Guides who speak multiple languages, but that can change every quarter. Please call our office at (951) 827-8687 to inquire about the availability of your specific language. We also welcome you to bring your own interpreter. Our Campus Tour Guide can customize their tour to allow time for your interpreter to translate for you throughout the tour. Are tours wheelchair accessible? Yes. Every tour option has an ADA route, making it wheelchair accessible. If needed, please request an ADA route in the "special accommodations" section of your reservation, so our office can plan accordingly. Is there a fee for the tour? No! UCR tours are free. We gladly welcome you to visit our campus and meet with our students, staff and faculty. What is an "Individuals/Families” visitor type? When scheduling a campus tour, select the "Individuals/Families" option if you are an individual student with up to 6 guests (parent/guardians, siblings and relatives) or a group with 2–9 prospective students. Complete a separate tour reservation for each prospective student to ensure they each receive a tour packet. (Groups of 10 or more prospective students can make one reservation for all students and will be taken on a "Group Tour.") Are children allowed on tours? Yes. Children are allowed on tours. However, if a child requires the use of a stroller, please notify our staff ahead of time so we can adjust the tour route accordingly. About The Tour What will I learn on the campus tour? The tour route typically follows a student’s walking path to class. It includes stops at a library, the Campus Store, the Highlander Union Building, popular student hangouts and more. Each tour includes a brief history of UCR and information about current academic programs, planned future growth, student life and athletics. Tours are led by current undergraduate students who are extremely knowledgeable about our campus and its programs. Student guides also share their personal UCR experiences, stories and insights. Can we visit a class? No. Unfortunately that would be disruptive to classes that are in session. Will we see the Residence Halls on the tour? Due to Covid- 19 regulations Group Residence Hall tours are currently not offered. How long is the tour? Campus tours are between 45-60 minutes long. What happens if I show up to a tour early or late? If you arrive early, you may be able to join an earlier tour, or you can grab a bite to eat on campus, or just chat with us and let us answer your questions. If you arrive late, we will do our best to add you to our next available tour. Some tour options may not be available to tour if you arrive more than 10 minutes late. Do you offer special tours for graduate students? No. The general campus tour provides comprehensive information perfect for undergraduate students. Most graduate students meet with the department to which they are applying. Contact the appropriate department representatives to coordinate a personal meeting. How can I meet a professor in a specific department? We recommend contacting the professor directly via email. Use the links below to find contact information. Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering (BCOE) Faculty College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (CHASS) Faculty College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences (CNAS) Faculty School of Business Faculty Graduate School of Education (GSOE) School of Public Policy (SPP) Group Tours What do you consider a “group”? A "group" is considered 10 or more prospective students from any institution or organization (schools, community or religious organizations, camps, etc.) When are group tours offered? Elementary and middle school group tours are offered on Tuesdays and Thursdays, on the hour, from 10 a.m.–2 p.m. High school and community college group tours are offered on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 10 a.m.–2 p.m. When should I make a reservation? Reservations for groups must be made at least two weeks in advance. We begin accepting reservations about one month prior to each quarter. Where should we park our bus? On-campus bus parking is not available and we recommending finding a place to park off-campus. Buses can drop off students at the bus stop across the street from Lot 4 on West Campus Drive. California exempt vehicles such as vans may park in Lot 1. When you arrive one of our tour guides will greet your group for check-in and proceed with your planned schedule.

The City of Riverside is a vibrant college town that welcomes and supports a diverse community. UC Riverside (UCR) shares the city with over 15 other higher education institutes. This makes Riverside home to a mighty collection of college students who are attracted to the city’s perfect balance of small-town friendliness and big-city fun. We’re talking about year-round Main Street festivals that celebrate everything and everyone. Thousands gather each year for our mesmerizing Fourth of July fireworks lit from the peak of our beloved Mount Rubidoux — and month-long wintertime "Festival of Lights," which was voted #1 Best Public Holiday Lights Display in the nation. (USA Today 10 Best, 2018) For everyday excitement, Riverside is rich with eclectic eateries, music venues, craft breweries, indie shops, and quaint boba and coffee houses — some owned and operated by UCR alumni. But what people love the most about Riverside is the location! It’s in the heart of Southern California — only an hour's drive to beaches, deserts, mountains, and metropolitan cities. A City for Fun-Seekers Riverside offers art, adventure, nature, music, comedy, sports, and just about anything else you can think of to feed your mind, body, and soul.

Serene hikes that bring you magically close to candy-colored sunrises and sunsets? You better believe we've got that! We have your kind of fun: Downtown music, art, and cultural or food festivals throughout the year, like the IE Taco Festival, Riverside Tamale Festival, Riverside Dickens Festival, and Riverside Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) — just to name a few. Monthly Riverside Artswalk, featuring art, music, and food. Karaoke spots all over town. Public art installations throughout the city, like Mariposa Alley. LOL (laugh-out-loud) comedians showcased at the Fox Performing Arts Center, including Ali Wong and Gabriel "Fluffy" Iglesias. Affordable bowling and skating all over town. Carnival rides, arcade games, and mini-golf at Castle Park. Miles of multi-level trails for hikes, bikes, and off-roading adventure.

Our university has world-ranked programs that can educate, connect and inspire you. How do you get into UC Davis? Undergraduate admissions Take the first steps on your way to being an undergrad! Image Graduate admissions Take your first steps toward becoming an Aggie grad student! Image Professional admissions View our extensive professional school options. Image Freshmen admission statistics All ranges reflect the middle 50% of students admitted as of July 16, 2021. You’re more than your GPA After looking at the statistics above, students sometimes wonder: Do I have to achieve that high a GPA to get into UC Davis? Or, if I meet or exceed the GPA shown, is that a guarantee that I’ll be admitted? In both cases, not necessarily. College fit is about more than GPA, and our admission selection process is about more than that, too. We admit well-rounded students who show they are prepared for university life through a combination of academic excellence, leadership, extracurricular activities and a demonstrated ability to overcome challenges and think outside the box. Transfer admission statistics Transfer GPA details You must earn at least a 2.40 GPA in your UC-transferable classes to meet UC requirements; California non-residents must earn at least a 2.80 GPA. However, UC Davis requires a minimum 2.80 GPA to be selected for admission, and many of our most popular programs may require a higher GPA. Strive to achieve your highest possible GPA in order to be most competitive. Transfer admission requirements Admission Resources The admission process can be stressful. UC Davis has an abundance of resources to help you take the first step toward becoming an Aggie!

It requires a valid Net ID to login and is run by campus Information Technology Services. EDUROAM EDUROAM (education roaming) is a secure wireless access service developed for the international research and education community. EDUROAM allows students, researchers, faculty, and staff from UCR with a valid Net ID to obtain Internet connectivity across campus and when visiting other participating institutions. UCR-GUEST UCR-GUEST is an open and non-encrypted wireless network that uses a browser-based captive portal to authenticate users. It is less secure than UCR-SECURE or EDUROAM. LibraryGuest If you are a visitor in the library and do not have a UCR NetID and Password, select this network. You can also use this network if you are having trouble connecting to the other networks. It only works in the library. Need Assistance?
